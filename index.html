                WHY HEALTHY HAIR IS IMPORTANT FOR YOUR OVERALL WELL-BEING?</h2>
                <p1 style="font-size: 110%;font-family: tahoma,sans-serif;">Hair care is a very important
                and a hygienic routine for both men and women. Nobody wants to go out with a frizzy, dry
                and unhealthy hair. By just washing your hair doesn’t necessarily mean you are sure
                you’ve done it right, hair care also involves proper grooming and making sure you are
                using the right hair care products.<br>According to indiatimes.com:</p1>
                <p2 style="font-size: 110%;"><b>WHETHER THE HAIR CARE TIPS WERE FOR
                HUMIDITY, SUMMER HEAT OR WINTER WINDS, THE COMMON IDEA BEHIND
                THEM ALL WAS THIS: HAIR HEALTH IS A REFLECTION OF HOW HEALTHY OR
                UNHEALTHY YOUR LIFE IS. GENETIC PRE-DISPOSITION MAY CAUSE
                HARMFUL EFFECTS, BUT HEALTHY LIVING MAY PREVENT ADVERSE
                CONDITIONS LIKE ALOPECIA. TAKING CARE OF YOUR HAIR IS AS
                IMPORTANT AS ANY OTHER PART OF THE BODY. WHILE YOU TEND TO COVER
                OTHER <br>BODY PARTS YOUR HAIR IS SUBJECTED TO A LOT OF POLLUTION,
                DIRT AND CHEMICALS.</b></p2>

                <h3 style="color:#20CCE1;font-size:120%;margin-bottom:-10px;font-family:
                verdana,sans-serif;">BOOSTS SELF-CONFIDENCE</h3>
                <p3 style="font-size: 110%;font-family: tahoma,sans-serif;">Hair is undoubtedly an
                important aspect of your physical appearance. Everything from the length and texture of
                your hair <br>to how you style it adds to how you channel your unique identity. In
                addition to that, your hair also affects your own perceived <br>attractiveness. This refers
                to how you see yourself through other's eyes.</p3>

                <h4 style="color:#20CCE1;font-size:120%;margin-bottom:-10px;font-family:
                verdana,sans-serif;">PROMOTES HEALTHY HAIR</h4>
                <p4 style="font-size: 110%;font-family: tahoma,sans-serif;margin-bottom:-4px;">Healthy
                hair is critical to the health and well-being of the condition of your hair, as hair that is not
                maintained can have split ends, <br>frizzy, and be extremely dry, which is neither healthy
                physically, nor good for your self-confidence. A hair salon will give you the <br>correct
                treatments to maintain your hair so it remains in a healthy, vibrant state, and allows you to
                have all the confidence that <br>comes with healthy hair.</p4>

                <h5 style="color:#20CCE1;font-size:120%;margin-bottom:-10px;font-family:

                <p5 style="font-size: 110%;font-family: tahoma,sans-serif;">Maintaining your hair
                contains a plethora of benefits that promote both healthy hygiene and self-esteem.
                However, maintaining <br>your hair can also provide longevity, as proper maintenance
                can reduce the chance of premature hair loss.</p5>

                <p6 style="font-size: 110%;font-family: tahoma,sans-serif;">Believe it or not, the condition
                of your hair can be one of the most important signs of your overall health. Vibrant, healthy

                body is operating at its peak condition. Unhealthy, dry and frizzy hair may be a sign that
                you may need to change your diet or hair care routine in order to promote your overall
                health and well-being.Healthy hair is critical to both your physical and mental well-being
                and should be taken seriously. With the proper maintenance and care, it is possible to have
                healthy, vibrant hair at all times. Furthermore, your overall confidence will be significantly
                improved and allows you to live a more fulfilling life.</p6>
